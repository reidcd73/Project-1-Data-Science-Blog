## Steps for Project
Using CRISP-DM to analyse Bristol Airbnb 

## 1) Pick a dataset.
Used Bristol Airbnb data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
files used - 1) calendar.csv  
             2) listings_bg.csv 
             3) reviews_bg.csv 

## 2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
     i) Are there any clear trends in the availability of the listings ?
     ii) Are there any trends in the pricing of  listings across the year ?
     iii) How are the listings distributed across the neighbourhoods and is there a clear price grouping ? 
     iv) Do any of the columns have a direct affect on the pricing ? 
     v) Could I train a model to predict the pricing of the listings ?

## 3) Create a Jupyter Notebook
    created a notebook - DS ND AirBNB Bristol.ipynb
    
    used the following libaries  - numpy , pandas , matplotlib.pyplot , seaborn & sklearn
    

## 4) Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize
Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

## 4) Communicate your business insights:

Created Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques
Create a blog post on medium.com -
